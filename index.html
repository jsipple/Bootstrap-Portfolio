            I got into coding because of the job I had in shipping. I started to code using vba for my job in shipping in order to add automation, because I liked coding and the benefits that it granted me I decided that I wanted to learn more about coding and transition into that industry. To
            that end I have been working towards certification online through freecodecamp.org and
            in person through a full-stack developer class at UNC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
            I also have a lot of expierence working with groups both near and far as for my job in shipping I coordinated all shipments and international documents for any shipments leaving both mine and our offsite warehouse in California. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Through freecodecamp I have recieved a Responsive web design certification (appx. 300hrs) and am working forward with the next certification which is for Javascript. To see the projects I have worked on in order to get this certification please see my portfolio page.
